# Amazon DenseClus

DenseClus is a Python module for clustering mixed type data using [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) and [HDBSCAN](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan). Allowing for both categorical and numerical data, DenseClus makes it possible to incoproate all features in clustering.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Amazon-DenseClus==0.0.12
```

## Usage

DenseClus requires a Panda's dataframe as input with both numerical and categorical columns.
All preprocessing and extraction are done under the hood, just call fit and then retrieve the clusters!

```python
from denseclus.DenseClus import DenseClus

clf = DenseClus(
    umap_combine_method="intersection_union_mapper",
)
clf.fit(df)

print(clf.score())
```

## Examples

A hands-on example with an overview of how to use is currently available in the form of a Jupyer notebook [here](https://github.com/smart-patrol/denseclus/blob/main/notebooks/DenseClus%20Example%20NB.ipynb).
